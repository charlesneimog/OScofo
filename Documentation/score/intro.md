# Intro

As `Antescofo`, `OScofo` uses a textual score where the composer must define the musical `EVENTS` and its consequences, what we call `ACTIONS`. In addition to that, `OScofo` has also some `CONFIG` keywords and the possibility to use `LUA` language to create interactive `ACTIONS`. In this section I explain all these concepts.

After Configuration, the Score will look like this:

On it, we have three `EVENTS`, and a lot of `ACTIONS`.
